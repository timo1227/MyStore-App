# Clothes Web Shop

  Project Focused on Creating a Web App where: 
  
  Users could create accounts and place orders on availble Products.
  Customers could check order history and write reviews for products that
  they have previously placed orders on. As Well as have custom Profile Pages
  where all their Reviews would be Shown if they wanted to, if not they could
  change they Account to private. 
  
  Admin assigned roles could login to check Orders placed by Customrs,
  Add Products, Check inventory of exisitng Products and edit them if needed.
  Admins could Assign custom Roles and activate/Deactivate them when needed.  
  
  PHP was used mainly to interect with the Database and sometime JS was used aswell 
  
  Used Bootstrap and Custom CSS to style the Web APP.
